Track Races
	Local Race Weekend
		Grudge Race
			GR - Race Specific Computer Racers / Can race for money, will keep a log of money made from each racer every 24hr, and limit it.
			GR - Race Specific Real Players / Can race for money, pinks, possibly businesses.
		Time Only
			TO - Race against your self / will win a small bonus for running a personal best, and good reaction time /
	Event Weekend

			 Championship pays out to top 10.


			Points Distribution
			  RDC = Real Driver Count;

				1st = 25 points + Real driver count;
				2nd = 23 points + RDC;
				3rd = 21 points + RDC;
				4th = 18 points + RDC;
				5th = 15 pints + RDC;
				6th = 12 points + RDC;
				7th = 8 points + RDC;
				8th = 4 points + RDC;
				9th+ = 1 point + RDC;

Racing System
	Current et system + the following

	60' - Is affected by traction amt / hp. 900 Traction / 600 HP = 1.5
		60' = 1.36; Traction(T) = 600; HP = 900;
			HPtoTRC1 = T/HP; 600/900 = .66666;
			HPtoTRC2 = 800T/900hp = 0.88888;
			if( HPtoTRC <= 1 ){
				SpinPercentage =  100 - ( 100 * .66666) = 33.334%;
				SpinPercentage =  100 - ( 100 * .88888) = 11.111%;

				New 60' = 60' * SpinPercentage;
					New 60' = (1.36 * 33.334%) + 1.36 = 1.976;
					New 60' = (1.36 * 11.111%) + 1.36 = 1.565;
			}

	ET - Is affected by the 60'. Eventually, it will be affected by all of the times (660', 11/8mi. etc.)
		60'1 = .9;  60'2 = (33.334%, 1.170 || 11.111%, 0.989); ET = 5.792;
			estimates: .9 60', 6.47 et; 1 60', 7.19 et; 1.1 60', 7.91 et; 1.2 60', 8.63 et; 1.3 60', 9.35 et; 1.5 60', 10.79 et; 1.8 60', 12.95 et;
									7.19 - 6.47 = .72;
			Answer: 0.1 60' = 0.72 ET;

			if ( New 60' >= 60'){
				Find the difference,
					Difference = New 60'(1.170) - 60'(.9);(33.334%)
					AddToEt    = ET(5.792) + (Difference(0.27) * .72 = 0.1944)
					New ET     = 5.986;
				TODO: Make sure that .72 works for a wide range of 60' and et's, may need to adjust number.
			}

	SPINNING MODULE, pop-up(?) (IF SPIN IS OVER ~75%)
		based on worse case scenario Spin Amount, you have that amount of time to reduce the Spin Amount to 0%, based on how you do there will determine
		how much the spin amount will affect the run. A .9 60' and 5.792 et, with 100% spin = 12.466 et. It will be scaled toward improving your time more
		by spinning less at the beginning. You will stop the spin by tapping the PEDAL button, depending on HPtoTRC and Spin Amount will determine how many taps.
